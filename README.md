This is my MSc thesis titled "Using Machine Learning Techniques to Create Neural Network Driving Agents, with a Focus on Reinforcement Learning". I trained AI driving agents using a genetic algorithm and the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm, where the TORCS racing simulation was used as the environment for training. 

The following GIF shows an example of one of the advanced driving agents created:

Abstract

 The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) is a car racing simulation game, which allows a player to
 race against opponents that are simulated by the computer. In this project, several AI opponents for
 this game have been developed, using various forms of machine learning on neural networks, which
 can be observed or raced against. The differences and advantages of genetic and reinforcement
 learning algorithms have been explored in this racing game context. Each parameter and condition of
 these algorithms were experimented upon diligently, to create AI agents that could complete laps of a
 race efficiently and rival human players.
 
 A racing simulation environment offers a unique set of challenges that are comparable to those faced
 by real-world autonomous vehicles, such as high-speed decision-making and spatial awareness. The
 exploration of this idea could uncover insights into the use of machine learning in such contexts.
 
 This thesis illustrates all experiments and findings, demonstrating the competency of trained agents,
 while also explaining the technical aspects of how research was conducted. Both algorithms have
 created simple and complex racing behaviours, such as following the track axis and/or racing line.
 However, a final model trained using the genetic algorithm demonstrated the best performance.
