# ðŸ“š MSc Thesis: "Using Machine Learning Techniques to Create Neural Network Driving Agents, with a Focus on Reinforcement Learning"

For my MSc thesis, I trained AI driving agents using a **genetic algorithm** and the **PPO reinforcement learning** algorithm. The **TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator)** was used as the environment for training these agents.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) is a racing simulation game where players race against computer-controlled opponents. In this project, I developed several AI agents for the game, using various machine learning techniques on neural networks. These agents were trained to complete laps efficiently and compete with human players.

The focus was on **genetic algorithms** and **reinforcement learning** (PPO), which were tested and compared to determine their effectiveness in training the AI agents.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: A form of evolutionary algorithm that uses a population of agents and evolves them through selection, crossover, and mutation. This method was experimented with in-depth to create agents that could successfully navigate the racing environment.

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that was used to train agents to make decisions based on rewards and penalties in the racing environment.

These algorithms were applied to a set of agents, each trained with different configurations, to explore the advantages and challenges of each technique in a racing simulation.

## ðŸš— Racing Simulation Environment

The **TORCS** environment offers challenges such as high-speed decision-making and spatial awareness, which closely mimic those faced by real-world autonomous vehicles. The research aimed to uncover insights into the application of machine learning in autonomous driving.

Each algorithm was carefully tuned to create agents that could follow the track axis and racing lines, simulating behaviors that would be useful in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

## ðŸ“‘ Abstract

The thesis explores the development of AI agents for **TORCS** using both **genetic algorithms** and **reinforcement learning**. The experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm in training agents to race efficiently and rival human drivers. The best-performing model was trained using the **genetic algorithm**, achieving the most reliable results in terms of lap completion times.
